# locally-hosted-youtube-downloader-chrome-extension
This Chrome extension enables downloading YouTube videos/audio via a local Python Flask backend. It uses yt-dlp for downloads. Users select quality in the popup, initiate downloads, and monitor progress. The backend is Dockerized, with .bat files for easy server start/stop on Windows.
